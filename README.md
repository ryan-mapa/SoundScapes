## Technologies and Technical Challenges

Rails back-end
OAuth
React Native
Spotify API
Google (maps) API

This mobile iOS application will be built using a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React Native, Node.js), which has many positives for this application.
+ Allows for JavaScript to be used for both client-side and server-side code.
+ React Native allows for quick prototyping and high initial velocity for a mobile application.
+ Object representation is JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) in both the back-end and the front-end.
+ Node.js's non-blocking I/O is great for quick simultaneous actions, like chat.

The technical challenges for this application will be:

+ Connecting our front-end with a NoSQL back-end database.
+ Understanding web-sockets and providing smooth user-to-user messaging.
+ Creating a virtual plant feature with a pleasing UI and seamless UX for user satisfaction.
+ Add graphics library / drawn images for the virtual plant.


## Technology details of MERN

### MongoDB
[mongoDB](https://npmjs.org/package/mongodb)

+ MongoDB is the database used in the MERN stack. Uses a NoSQL document-oriented database, with a flexible schema and a JSON based query language.
  + For example, for our app, we would have users and photos. Typically, a relational database would create two tables - one for users, one for photos with `user_id`. With a NOSQL database, we would store all the data as a single document, and fetch it all at once with any level of nesting.
+ MongoDB has the ability to index on deeply nested fields unlike RDBMS's.
+ Storing an object in a MongoDB database does not have to follow a schema like Rails.
+ Data is also retrieved in JSON format.  + Comes with a shell built on JS runtime like Node.js. (Like Rails C but for MongoDB)

### Express.js
[express](http://expressjs.com/)

+ The Express.js framework provides specific routes for data retrieved from HTTP requests.

+ Acts as the rails for Node.js.

+ Express parses request URL, headers and parameters via Regex. On the response side, it has, as expected, all functionality required by web applications. This includes setting response codes and setting cookies.

### React Native
[react native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)
+ React Native library lets you build mobile apps using Javascript and React, indistinguishable from apps built with Obj-C, Swift, or Java.

### Node.js

[node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
+ Google's V8 run-time environment used for running server-sided JavaScript. Used alongside express with MongoDB.

### FEATURE Overview

Major rundown on core features (ex: chat) so like, the map view or something...


**How it works in SoundScapes**

In Woven, we are dealing with a single chatroom with two people.

On the **server side**, we have a simple Express.js application which does 2 things:

+ 1) a `GET '/'` request handler in the chatroom box, for the message board / Send button to create a new message.

+ 2) Websockets server for messages from websocket clients.


+ **Websockets**: an upgrade to typical HTTP requests - allows for bi-directional data transfer between the client and server.
[socket.io](https://socket.io/) seems to work the best.
(as opposed to HTTP unidirectional flow where the server must take on all the client requests before moving on)

On the **client side**, we have:

+ a page with 2 handlers
  + 1) on the Send button, which picks up the input message.
  + 2) one that listens for new messages on the websockets client, AKA listens for messages sent by the SO, to update the `current_user`'s' message board.

**Step by step** hereâ€™s what happens when `current_user` sends a message.:

+ 1) app notices the 'Send' button click through a JS event handler.
+ 2) emits a websocket message through the websocket client connected to the server.
+ 3) the partner receives the new message as a push message through a websocket component running in the SO's application.
+ 4) message is obtained, and chat is updated.

### API Endpoints with MongoDB

If we were using Rails, we would need to convert to and from JSON. With Node.js, we can simply deliver JSON objects through RESTful APIs for the client. With MongoDB, we don't have to worry about the conversion between JSON and Ruby. Also, we avoid the need for multiple data-type conversions by using a uniform data serialization format across the client, server, and database.


## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Learn Technologies (2 days)

+ Objective: All group members will dedicate the weekend to learning each component of the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React Native, Node.js) stack and become familiar with the overall workflow.

+ By the end of Day 2, we will have:
  + Completed Proposal README
  + Understanding of MERN

### Phase 2: Backbone (3 days)

+ Phase 2a: User Authentication (All) (1 day):
  + Objective: Set up user authentication via React Native and Auth0 API.
  + By the end of the Day 3, we will have:
    + User can sign up and login that persist through sessions unless logged out.


+ Phase 2b: Splash (Janet) + Home/Index Page (Keith/Jared) (2 days):
  + Objective: Set up functional index page for the application, that allows for easy access to other features.
  + By the end of the day, we will have:
    + An index page that allows the user to navigate to the app's features.


+ Phase 2c User Profiles (Greg and Evelyn) (2 days):
  + Objective: Set up User Profiles
  + By the end of the day, we will have:
    + Users can access and edit their profile page.


### Phase 3: MVP Features  (4 days)

+ Phase 3a: Virtual Plant (4 days) (Janet and Keith)
  + Features include:
    + Plant attributes: name of plant, type of plant, age, description, health, happiness.
    + Functionality: water, sunlight.
    + Display: feature icon, background with time of day, water button, feeding button, image of plant at different stages, name, happiness level, health of plant.


+ Phase 3b: Instant Messaging w/ [socket.io](https://socket.io/) (4 days) (Evelyn, Greg, Jared)
  + Features include:
    + Stickers / Emoticons
    + Photos
    + Mood tracker / status
    + Database for message storage


## Plan for getting users and reviews

+ All members will each share with at least 20 friends and family members.
+ Soft launch with close friends.
+ Janet will post in an appropriate sub-reddit and Product Hunt for exposure.
+ Evelyn will submit the app for review on the App store.
